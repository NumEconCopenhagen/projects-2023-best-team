# Model analysis project

In this assignment we wish to analyse and solve a simpel Stackelberg Model, first we will use symbolic python to solve the model, afterwards we will solve it numerically and lastly apply some extensions to the model.
The Stackelberg model is a model of competitions wherein one company is the leader and the secound company is the follower, the leader is able to set production first giving it an advantage.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, we use numpy, sympy and matplotlib
